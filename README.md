# Solana NFT Marketplace APIs

This repository documents in [cURL](https://curl.se/) requests and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collections various Solana NFT marketplace APIs.

You'll need either cURL or Postman installed to use this repository. If you are unsure which to choose use Postman as it has an easy to use GUI.

This data is useful for building applications on top of the marketplace, e.g., a Discord bot to show when a new item is listed.

All example requests use the [Skeleton Crew's](https://skeletoncrew.rip/) collection of NFTs. 

To use another NFT collection, verify the correct name at the marketplace in question.

For example, at Magic Eden you can find the name in the URL of your browser's address bar.

For an NFT collection like Solana Monkey Business the URL looks like the following.
```
https://magiceden.io/marketplace/solana_monkey_business
```

In the request to Magic Eden swap out `skeleton_crew_skulls` for `solana_monkey_business`. Everything else can stay the same.

You'll notice that each marketplace names their collections slightly differently so pay close attention to the spelling.
